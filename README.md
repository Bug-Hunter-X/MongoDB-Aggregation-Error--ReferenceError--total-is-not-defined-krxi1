This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: referencing a non-existent field within the `$group` stage. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to sum a field that doesn't exist in the documents. The solution involves carefully reviewing the document structure and correcting the field name in the aggregation pipeline.
